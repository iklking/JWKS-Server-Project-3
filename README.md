# JWKS Server Project 3
## Dependencies
pip install cryptography <br />
pip install pyjwt <br />

## Compiling
python3 Project3.py

## Notes
I used the base code from project 2 to complete this project because my code from project 1 was not working with the databases <br />
Make sure to delete the database file each time you run the program so the /auth works <br />
